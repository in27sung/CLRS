**Exercise 1.1-1**
An example of a real world situation that would require sorting would be if
you wanted to keep track of a bunch of people’s file folders and be able to look
up a given name quickly. A convex hull might be needed if you needed to secure
a wildlife sanctuary with fencing and had to contain a bunch of specific nesting
locations.

**Exercise 1.1-2**
One might measure memory usage of an algorithm, or number of people
required to carry out a single task.

**Exercise 1.1-3**
An array. It has the limitation of requiring a lot of copying when re-sizing,
inserting, and removing elements.

**Exercise 1.1-4**
They are similar since both problems can be modeled by a graph with
weighted edges and involve minimizing distance, or weight, of a walk on the
graph. They are diﬀerent because the shortest path problem considers only
two vertices, whereas the traveling salesman problem considers minimizing the
weight of a path that must include many vertices and end where it began.

**Exercise 1.1-5**
If you were for example keeping track of terror watch suspects, it would be
unacceptable to have it occasionally bringing up a wrong decision as to whether
a person is on the list or not. It would be fine to only have an approximate
solution to the shortest route on which to drive, an extra little bit of driving is
not that bad.
