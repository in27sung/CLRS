## 2.1 Insertion sort

### Sorting problem 
**Input**: A sequence of $n$ numbers $$<a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n>$$.

**Output**: A permutation (reordering) $$<a_1^\{'}, a_2^{'}, \dots, a_n^{'}>$$. of the input sequence such that $$a_1^\{'} \leq a_2^{'} \leq \dots \leq a_n^{'}$$.

**keys**: The number to be storted
**satellite data**: The input comes in the form of an array with $n$ elements. When we want to srot numbers, it's often beacuse they are the keys accociated with other data.
**recode**: A key and satellite data form
